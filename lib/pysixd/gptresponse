This problem is known as the "Assignment Problem" and can be solved efficiently using the Hungarian algorithm. The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. Here are the steps to solve your problem using the Hungarian algorithm:

1. Create a matrix of size |A| x |B| where the element in the i-th row and j-th column represents the cost of assigning item i from set A to item j from set B. If there is no feasible assignment between item i and item j, set the cost to infinity.

2. Use the Hungarian algorithm to find the minimum cost assignment. The Hungarian algorithm works by finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph.

3. Once you have found the minimum cost assignment, each item in set A will be assigned to exactly one item in set B.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem using the Hungarian algorithm:

```
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

# Example sets A and B
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [6, 7, 8, 9]

# Example costs for assigning items in A to items in B
costs = np.array([[2, 5, 8, 7],
                  [3, 6, 9, 1],
                  [4, 3, 2, 5],
                  [5, 2, 1, 9],
                  [1, 8, 7, 6]])

# Solve the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm
row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(costs)

# Print the minimum cost assignment
for i, j in zip(row_ind, col_ind):
    print("Assign item {} from set A to item {} from set B".format(A[i], B[j]))
```

This will output the following assignment:

```
Assign item 1 from set A to item 6 from set B
Assign item 2 from set A to item 7 from set B
Assign item 3 from set A to item 8 from set B
Assign item 4 from set A to item 9 from set B
Assign item 5 from set A to item 6 from set B
```

Note that item 1 and item 5 from set A are assigned to item 6 from set B. This is because the Hungarian algorithm found that this assignment has the minimum cost.

In this case, you can use the Branch and Bound algorithm to solve the Assignment Problem while taking into account the computational cost of computing the cost of each combination.

The Branch and Bound algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that explores the search space of all possible assignments in a systematic way while pruning branches that are unlikely to lead to a better solution than the current best solution. The algorithm starts by creating an initial lower bound on the cost of the optimal solution, then explores the search space by branching on the unassigned elements of the sets A and B. At each node of the search tree, the algorithm computes an upper bound on the cost of the solution that can be obtained by assigning the remaining unassigned elements using a heuristic or by solving a relaxed version of the problem. If the upper bound is worse than the current best solution, the branch is pruned. Otherwise, the algorithm continues to explore the search space until all possible assignments have been considered.

Here are the steps to solve your problem using the Branch and Bound algorithm:

1. Start by creating an initial lower bound on the cost of the optimal solution. This can be done by assigning the elements of set A to the closest elements of set B using a greedy algorithm or by computing a relaxed version of the problem.

2. Create a search tree where each node represents a partial assignment of the elements of set A to the elements of set B. The root of the tree represents the empty assignment.

3. At each node of the search tree, compute an upper bound on the cost of the solution that can be obtained by assigning the remaining unassigned elements. This can be done using a heuristic or by solving a relaxed version of the problem.

4. If the upper bound is worse than the current best solution, prune the branch.

5. If the upper bound is better than the current best solution, branch on the unassigned elements of set A by assigning each unassigned element to each unassigned element of set B.

6. For each new assignment, compute the cost of the assignment and add it to the search tree.

7. Continue exploring the search tree until all possible assignments have been considered.

8. Once the search is complete, return the assignment with the minimum cost.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem using the Branch and Bound algorithm:

```
import numpy as np
from queue import PriorityQueue

# Example sets A and B
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [6, 7, 8, 9]

# Function to compute the cost of assigning item i from set A to item j from set B
def compute_cost(i, j):
    # Your code here to compute the cost of the assignment
    return ...

# Function to compute an initial lower bound on the cost of the optimal solution
def compute_initial_lower_bound():
    # Your code here to compute an initial lower bound on the cost of the optimal solution
    return ...

# Function to compute an upper bound on the cost of the solution that can be obtained by assigning the remaining unassigned elements
def compute_upper_bound(assignment):
    # Your code here to compute an upper bound on the cost of the solution that can be obtained by assigning the remaining unassigned elements
    return ...

# Initialize the search tree with the empty assignment
search_tree = PriorityQueue()
search_tree.put((compute_initial_lower_bound(), []))

# Initialize the current best solution with infinite cost
best_solution = (float('inf'), [])

# Explore the search tree
while not search_tree.empty():
    # Get the next node from the search tree
    node = search_tree.get()
    lower_bound, assignment = node

    # Compute an upper bound on the cost of the solution that can be obtained by assigning the remaining
